Mumbai Meri Jaan Hai
Jeevan Ek Sangharsh Hai
Baarish Ki Woh Raat
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Go back to the drawing board
On the ball
Under the weather
Cut somebody some slack
Get something off your chest
Hang in there
Miss the boat
Pull yourself together
So far so good
That's the last straw
Birds of a feather flock together
Give someone the cold shoulder
He has bigger fish to fry
Ignorance is bliss
Kill two birds with one stone
Picture paints a thousand words
Put all eggs in one basket
Saving for a rainy day
Waste not want not
Better late than never
Costs an arm and a leg
Don't give up the day job
Elvis has left the building
Feel a bit under the weather
Hear it on the grapevine
Hit the sack
Leave no stone unturned
Method to my madness
Not playing with a full deck
Off one's rocker
Play devil's advocate
Put wool over other people's eyes
Steal someone's thunder
Wouldn't be caught dead
Back to square one
Bite your tongue
Comparing apples and oranges
Drive someone up the wall
Easier said than done
Fit as a fiddle
Get cold feet
Hold your horses
Keep an eye on things
Let your hair down
Mum's the word
Pass the buck
Run out of steam
Save your breath
Sink or swim
Spill the beans
Start from scratch
Take the plunge
Tip of the iceberg
Twist someone's arm
Walk on eggshells
Wear your heart on your sleeve
When pigs fly
Word of mouth
Apna kaam banta
Bhaagte bhoot ki langoti sahi
Naach na jaane aangan tedha
Oont ke munh mein jeera
Jitni chadar utne pair pasaro
Aam ke aam guthliyon ke daam
Apni gali mein kutta bhi sher
Ghar ki murgi daal barabar
Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swaad
Ek teer se do nishane
Daal mein kuch kaala hai
Apne pair par kulhadi maarna
Aankhon ka taara hona
Din mein taare dikhna
Ghee ke diye jalana
Haath par haath dhare baithna
Kaan par joon na rengna
Paani paani ho jaana
Raat gayi baat gayi
Sau sunar ki ek lohar ki
Sir par kafan baandhna
Muh mein Ram bagal mein chhuri
Jiski laathi uski bhains
Doobte ko tinke ka sahara
Ab pachtaye hot kya
Jab chidiya chug gayi khet
Andhon mein kaana raja
Akal badi ya bhains
Jo garajte hain woh baraste nahin
Chaar din ki chandni
Phir andheri raat hai
Ek myan mein do talwarein
Kahin ki eent kahin ka roda
Bhanumati ne kunba joda
Chalti ka naam gaadi
Apna haath Jagannath
Dur ke dhol suhavne lagte
Nau do gyarah ho jaana
Aasman se gira khajoor pe atka
Rassi jal gayi par bal nahi gaya
Mehnat ka phal meetha hota hai
Sabar ka phal meetha hota hai
Jaisi karni waisi bharni
Koyle ki dalali mein haath kaale
Bheegi billi ban jaana
Apna ullu seedha karna
Eid ka chaand hona
Paanchon ungliyaan ghee mein hona
Apne muh miyan mitthu banna
Jale par namak chhidakna
Dikhane ke daant alag hote hain
Taali ek haath se nahin bajti
Chor ki daadhi mein tinka
Thotha chana baaje ghana
Saanp ko doodh pilana
Paani mein rehkar magar se bair
Khatte angoor kehna
Tel dekho tel ki dhaar dekho
Jahaan chaah wahaan raah
Bina seva mewa nahin milta
Kaala akshar bhains barabar
Aankh ka andha naam Nainsukh
Bagal mein chhora shahar mein dhindhora
Ek anaar sau bimaar
Laaton ke bhoot baaton se nahin maante
Aage kuan peeche khaai
Neki kar dariya mein daal
Adhjal gagri chhalkat jaaye
Sau chuhe khaakar billi Hajj ko chali
Ganga gaye Ganga Das Jamuna gaye Jamuna Das
Seedhi ungli se ghee nahin nikalta
Jab tak saans tab tak aas
Is haath de us haath le
Kangaali mein aata geela
Kuch toh gadbad hai
Kya chal raha hai
Sab theek ho jaayega
Chinta mat karo
Mujhe maaf kar do
Der aaye durust aaye
Apna khayal rakhna
Jald hi milenge
Aap kaise hain
Main theek hoon
Aur sab kaise hain
Ghar par sab kaise hain
Kya ho raha hai
Koi baat nahin
Yeh koi badi baat nahin
Aisa kuch nahin hai
Mere pet mein chuhe kood rahe hain
Daanton tale ungli dabana
Din dugni raat chauguni
Aankhen churana band karo
Mujhe aankhen mat dikhao
Baat ka batangad banana
Zyada baaten mat banao
Bael ka bael rahna
Bhains ke aage been bajana
Cheenti ki chaal chalna
Chhati par moong dalna
Chullu bhar paani mein doob maro
Daant khatte karna
Doodh ka doodh paani ka paani
Eent ka jawab patthar se dena
Gade murde ukhadna
Tum Hi Ho
