Prosperity is just around the corner.
Riches certainly make themselves wings.
Sleep faster  we need the pillows.
Welcome as the flowers in May.
All cruelty springs from weakness.
Wickedness is weakness.
My dear  my better half.
Nothing is easy to the unwilling.
Fall seven times  stand up eight.
Man is both determined and self-determining.
Night is the mother of counsels.
Wisdom comes alone through suffering.
Great men are not always wise.
Deliberate often - decide once.
Knowledge comes  but wisdom lingers.
The wisdom of our ancestors.
Some are weather-wise  some are otherwise.
Wisdom is only found in trudi.
Great men are not always wise.
Irrevocable as a haircut.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
At their wits' end.
A woman is always buying something.
Woman's place is in the wrong.
Women always have some mental reservation.
Cbercbez lafemme. (Find the woman.)
The crown of creation.
Earth's noblest thing  a Woman perfected.
Woman's at best a contradiction still.
Fraily  thy name is woman!
Never mistake motion for action.
Procrastination is the thief of time.
Now or never was the time.
Every artist was first an amateur.
Wonder is the basis of worship.
Words writ in waters.
Fair words butter no parsnips.
Mum is the word.
How forcible are right words!
Words are feminine  deeds are masculine.
Words will build no walls.
He multiplieth words without knowledge.
Languages are the pedigree of nations.
Numbers constitute the only universal language.
Soft words are hard arguments.
The medium is the message.
The thoughtless are rarely wordless.
More than kisses  letters mingle souls.
Words are feminine  deeds are masculine.
Everyone hears only what he understands.
The monarchy is a labour-intensive industry.
Love of bustle is not industry.
Work is more fun than fun.
The Gods rank work above virtues.
Amateurs hope. Professionals work.
I work as my father drank.
How do I work? I grope.
Congenial labor is essence of happiness.
Don't be afraid of hard work.
The work praises the man.
Honest labor bears a lovely face.
Ambition is destruction  only competence matters.
Success is dependent on effort.
Sweat plus sacrifice equals success.
Work is the province of cattle.
To industry  nothing is impossible.
Fortune is ever seen accompanying industry.
Busy people are never busybodies.
Elbow grease is the best polish.
Exchange is creation.
Handle your tools without mittens.
It's all in the day's work.
Many hands make light work.
This world's a bubble.
But it does move.
World without end.
A mad world  my masters.
Worry is a form of fear.
What worries you  masters you.
There is no victory without pain.
Excellence costs a great deal.
Misfortunes tell us what fortune is.
From a fallen tree  make kindling.
Glee! The great storm is over!
Sweet are the uses of adversity.
Memoirs: the backstairs of history.
That's not writing  that's typing.
I think with my right hand.
Get black on white.
Flaubert had infinite correction to perform.
Less is more.
Publication is a self-invasion of privacy.
Only the young die good.
Youth has become a class.
Reckless youth makes rueful age.
Youth will be served.
Blind zeal can only do harm.
My zeal hath consumed me.
